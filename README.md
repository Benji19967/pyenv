# Pyenv

Sometimes you just need to quickly whip up a python virtual environment with some 
default packages installed in it.

## Creating an env 

`make env`

## Activating the env

`source env/bin/activate`

## Adding new packages

`.poetry_venv/bin/poetry add <package name>`

## Temporarily adding new packages
 
`pip install <package name>`
